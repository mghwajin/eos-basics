# Install Endeavour OS

Key steps for the installation process:

1. Download the files
2. Verify the file was provided from an authentic source
3. Verify the file is not corrupt and/or was tampered with

## ISO verification 
From the Endeavour OS [download mirrors list](https://endeavouros.com/), download the **.ISO**, **Sha512sum**, and **GPG .SIG** files into the same directory.

Download the files
Verify the ISO
GPG signature
sha512sum

Before installing any files, you need to verify that:
1. The downloaded **`.ISO`** file is from an authentic and secure source
2. Tthe **`.ISO`** file has been downloaded without any errors (i.e. the file is not corrupted)

These two steps are critically important to do before installing any Linux distribution.
