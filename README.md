## General information

[**Endeavour OS**](https://endeavouros.com/) (EOS) is an open-source and resource-light Linux distribution based on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/).

Arch-based distros are **rolling-release** and release small system updates every day. Users can choose when to update and what parts of daily updates they would like to install, encouraging a freer user-customized experience.

This rolling-release structure additionally means users don't need to install major OS updates 1-2 times a year (as long as they update regularly). [Mercury Neo 6.13.7](https://endeavouros.com/news/mercury-neo-with-linux-6-13-7-and-arch-mirror-ranking-bug-fix/), the latest major OS update, was released on March 23, 2025\.
